Per file change you MUST update the changelog after you edited/added/removed a file! (first analyse if you actually succeeded editing the file) then you must add a new line to the changelog in this format: "[time and date] filename.extension - explanation" for example: "[14:02 01-01-2026] index.html - fixed a bug."
